Mulberry Creek Boardwalk to Mud Creek Trail brings you to a nice soybean field. Right on Watch House Trail. Right on Neck Fields Trail onward to Brewer's Trail to Brewer's Point canoe-in campground. And then back. Up to the campground you are near stagnate water and it smells like it. I did not go on the sidetrails due to the massive number of mosquitos.

"Hey folks,
So I’ve been looking at Warrior Expeditions while mapping out my Appalachian Trail plans. On the surface, it all looks shiny and solid — but I’ve also seen a couple things that make me tilt my head like, “hmm, is this for real or just good marketing?”

Has anyone here actually gone through their program or dealt with them face-to-face? I’m not after the brochure version — just the boots-on-the-ground truth.

I’m all about vets getting opportunities like this, but before I dive in, I’d love to know if this is truly juice worth the squeeze… or just a lemon.

Appreciate any firsthand insight — and feel free to tell me straight.

"White Oak Canyon Trail in Shenandoah National Park is full of life this time of year! Although there are plenty of places along the trail to take a quick dip in the Robinson River, the swimming hole at the bottom of the Lower Falls is the best. 

We got to the trailhead before 8am and enjoyed the falls alone for over 30 minutes! We highly recommend getting there as early as possible if you prefer solitude. 

Check out the details ⬇️ 

- 3 miles out-and-back
- 400ft elevation gain

2. This post is interesting because it highlights the personal experiences of hikers, particularly those considering solo hiking on the Appalachian Trail (AT). The question about the percentage of solo hikers and whether they wish they had companionship reflects a common concern among hikers about safety and social interaction, which I take into account when maintaining trails and ensuring a positive experience.

"Dow Thet. H is not silent. Started this hike the day after yesterday's lost.

Beard's Gap Trail to Mountain Top Trail to Ross Camp Trail to Wilson Creek Trail to Beard's Gap Trail. Loop is about 7 miles. Start 8:45am and returned 1:15pm. It would have been an even 4 hours if I didn't linger at some views and the top view. I will not be complaining about the grades. I knew what I was getting into when I started this loop.

Beard's Gap has pretty streams and shale out crops. Don't trust the creek stones when crossing. It's a nice warm-up for the switchbacks ahead. 
.
Mountain Top Trail is mostly a shale beast up and down. You think you reached the top and nope, more climbs.There is no trail camping at Douthat. But the park borders the George Washington National Park. Part of this trail goes into the GW Park. There is a spot that is a great location for trail camping. A comfortable stone pillar to refresh at the top. Enjoy the views.

Rose Camp Trail. Uphill, good luck. Downhill, pay attention to your steps. Stop once in awhile and pat a tree, refocus, enjoy the drop-offs.

Wilson Creek Trail is a moderate trail that will make you grumble. Rose Camp Trail goes below grade and then Wilson goes above grade. More climbs but not aggressive. Just more climbs.  Wilson is near the road and lodges. And can be used for the final section I reviewed yesterday without being on the road as long.

The rangers aren't just nice. They are super nice.

Definitely coming back. 43 trail miles.

"14 years ago, initially taking long weekends with friends, I started hiking the Appalachian Trail.  I remember long drives, fun times, lots of gear checks, fires, snow, rain, stars, and milkshakes on the drive back. We drove each time, all the way to Harper's Ferry, then we began to fly.  I've stayed at and passed through some lovely towns:  Asheville, Hot Springs, Damascus, Perisburg. Delaware Water Gap, Fort Montgomery, Great Barrington, Hanover, Gorman, Bethel, and Monson.  I've met some great folks along the way, and I am appreciative of their friendship, advice, and assistance.

On September 16, I completed this great journey by summitting Mount Katahdin, the AT Northern terminus.  The moment was made even better by having my cousin-in-law join me for the climb ( and the challenging climb down!).  

2196 miles, across 14 states, taking me 23 segments, going once or twice every year!  The last segment was 150 miles through remote central Maine woods, streams, lakes, and mountains.  I had gorgeous weather and great camp sites and hiked 10-16 miles a day. Shout out to the Maine AppalachianTrail Club for their well-maintained shelters, privy, campsites and trails.  The pictures are from this last hike.

What's next?   More adventures!!!",https://www.facebook.com/groups/thruhikers,UzpfSTEwMDAwMjAyMDYxNjU2NjpWSzo0MTc4NTUyMzU1Nzk2NzY1,2025-09-23 12:55:21+00:00,fall,joy,0.6008,"social, fun, challenging, scenic","1. Yes

"I took a last minute trip to Dow Thet (silent h) and camped at White Oak. Rangers are nice at registration and the gift shop/restaurant at another location. My only interaction with rangers here as yet.

This review is about the Tobacco House Ridge Trail. From the White Oak entrance. Park. Walk over bridge. The trail is trail on left just pass the first campsite on left.
The first half mile is straight uphill. It levels out and then round a corner. Straight uphill again. In the distance it appears to level off and then gd. Straight uphill again.
At the top enjoy the bench and the dam waterfall in the distance. I left out the ""n"".
Following the trail left it descends for about a mile at the grade you just went up. I will come back to that. Actually I won't.
Don't get distracted by side trails. Keep bearing right. Speaking of bear. Found responsibly fresh bear scat.
When you dead end at a fence go left over small bridge. Now just keep bearing left. You will see a gravel trail on right. Ignore it. Shortly you will see stairs.
Up the stairs. As you stop and sit on the stairs you will see it's a natural amphitheater. At the top is a bench, a wonderful bench. Take a wiz and rest. Beautiful view of Douthat Lake. Cross the goose poop path.
Another beautiful view of lake and small dam. Down the other set of stairs. Bear left on the tree line.
Welcome to two other dams. Very pretty. Lots of different views available. From here you can be a masochist and go to Blue Suck Falls Trail (yeah, I didn't name it, but there you go) and meet the mile straight up hill you left on Tobacco House Ridge Trail. Or...
Follow the gravel picnic area, on left facing away from last dam, to the main park road (not a busy road). Go right. Pay attention it's still a road and take to registration building. Cross road and your back at starting point.
I highly recommend this trail and route.",https://www.facebook.com/groups/1082114541911181,UzpfSTYxNTcyNTAzOTQ2MDAwOlZLOjk5MzM4ODMwNjAwNjc1NzQ=,2025-07-27 11:01:51+00:00,summer,neutral,0.8278,"scenic, wildlife","Error: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for gpt-4o-mini in organization org-CDRIzO2QPMzCZ3xL0xcnjqNL on requests per min (RPM): Limit 500, Used 500, Requested 1.

"I got a last-minute text from a buddy yesterday to go hiking, and even though I wasn’t planning on it originally, I was so glad I headed out. It was just a few hours in between being at home not thinking at all that I’d be on the trail, to standing on a ridge watching the sun sink behind the trees. It made me think how unexpected hikes are kind of in a category of their own.

Because sure, sometimes in hiking (and in real life) the unexpected can be less than ideal. But on the other hand, those detours or spontaneous moments end up way more memorable than planned ones. Some of the best hikes of my life have come from a “why not?” decision, or from missing a blaze and winding up somewhere new. 

The missed turn is a classic I know far too well. Setting out for a short loop, suddenly I’m on a trail I’ve never walked before, and I add way more time to the hike than I anticipated. At first, it might be frustrating, but then the path opens up to a hidden waterfall, a quiet overlook, or a section of forest I never would’ve explored otherwise. Or sometimes it leads to other hikers who made the exact same mistake and a bonding moment! What starts as a mistake often turns into a story I’ll tell for years.

As much as I love our maps, itineraries, and gear lists, the trail always finds a way to surprise me. The unpredictability of it all can be genuinely exciting though! It catches me off guard, challenges me, and maybe makes me notice something I otherwise wouldn’t have known existed. And embracing the detours, delays, or just plain accidents is part of the journey. 

Just a reflection and appreciation of what makes trails fun. 

What’s your most memorable unexpected hiking story? Was it a wrong turn, a sudden invitation, or a trail you stumbled onto by chance?

1. Whoever left the cooler with drinks. (There wasn't a name, but we left you a sticker).

3. Sir Stops A Lot for the delicious chicken and dumplings (along with the grilled cheese). 😋
4. Cruel Shoes who is the AT Class of 83. That soda and candy were so good coming out of the 100 Mile Wilderness. (We hope you got that next peak you were working on). 
5. Ranger Don who made our check in for the Birches a breeze! Also, Ranger Pete which we did not get a picture with. 😔 He also made everything so easy and was very reassuring. 
6. Chilli P who surprised us all at the Birches with pizza. (We'll, he had it all...). We definitely needed those carbs today!

"First of all: congrats to the NOBOs who have/are/will wrap up their hike soon. What an accomplishment!

Looking for some advice. ￼I live in Atlanta and I’m an experienced section hiker. My son who is 15 is showing a real interest in backpacking and wants to do a couple days on the trail in November, the weekend before thanksgiving. I was looking at going SOBO from Neels Gap to Springer, over 3 days and 2 nights. I believe it’s around 30miles. Would that be an appropriate trip for mid November? My son hasn’t backpacked much, but he’s an experienced camper and a long distance runner so I’m not too worried about mileage, etc. The only wildcard i can think of is weather  Just wanted y’all’s thoughts. Thanks!",https://www.facebook.com/groups/thruhikers,UzpfSTI4MzAxNTcwOlZLOjQxNzY2MzU5NTkzMjE3Mzg=,2025-09-22 01:36:22+00:00,fall,joy,0.3785,challenging,"1. Yes  
2. This post is interesting because it highlights a potential hiking trip on the trail, specifically from Neels Gap to Springer, which is relevant for our community. The inquiry about weather conditions in mid-November also indicates a thoughtful approach to safety, which aligns with my goal of maintaining a safe hiking experience. The mention of the son being an ""experienced camper and a long distance runner"" suggests that they may be well-prepared for the trip, but I would advise them to still consider the weather as a wildcard.

"Preparing this coming weekend for my first mother-son backpacking trip! 

Starting out really easy for him. He is 7 with high functioning autism, ADHD, and ODD. But this is something he wanted to do. I asked him if he wanted to go backpacking this weekend, and he said ""yes, on the Appalachian trail with a waterfall!"" 

While I doubt we will see a waterfall, I am running with his enthusiasm. 

We park at a parking area, hike 3.1 miles (660 gain) to a shelter, eat dinner and play some uno and spend time together, then hike back the same 3.1 miles back to our car. Doing this to avoid a shuttle. 

I foresee myself carrying 55+ pounds with all his stuff (I normally carry 40-45 myself). He will carry his tablet, his water bladder, and his stuffed animal.

But for the 6 mile round trip, I don't mind carrying at all that much. My question is this: being we are hiking to a shelter and out of the ""NOBO bubble"", should I pack my 2p tent just in case others are at the shelter or should I leave it at home?

2. This post is not interesting to me because the trails mentioned, like ""13 miles at Riverbend,"" seem too long and challenging for a beginner hiker like myself.

"March 30th I stepped onto the Appalachian Trail having never backpacked a day in my life. I set out on this grand journey completely out of shape and overweight not thinking I would ever be able to even get out of Georgia. This journey was the hardest thing I have ever done physically, mentally, and emotionally. I had no idea the changes that would transpire over the course of this journey and how much it would break me down, and build me back up to who I am today.

I give so much thanks to all the amazing people that have encouraged and helped me along the way. I have experienced so much generosity from strangers it was absolutely incredible. From hostels to townspeople, shuttle drivers to random rides to town, to the trail magic and angels the trail provided so much more than I ever imagined. 

I am forever grateful for this opportunity and that I did not quit even when I wanted too. This trail is truly a special place that will forever hold a spot in my heart. Thank you to everyone I encountered that pushed me to become a better version of myself and helped me along the way.

"I’m planning to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail in 2027 and looking for the right person to share the journey with.

About me: 53M, good shape, easy-going, supportive, no criminal record, and drama-free. I’m open to hiking with a man or woman — sexual orientation doesn’t matter.

I’m hoping to find someone with solid hiking experience who is kind, patient, and committed. This is my way of spreading a little trail magic, and I’m willing to help offset some expenses for the right partner.

If this sounds like a good fit, please message me — serious hikers only, please.

"She revisited the outfitter, 
choosing the same salesman. 
She approached him with a smile, saying 
'It's me again,' while holding up her pants. 
He smiled and replied, 
'I suppose you'd like to try them on,' before retrieving the key. 
Although the pants were costly, 
they were discounted by half. 
She purchased them and exited the store, 
where her trusted hiking partner, 
Gaada Bait, was waiting. 
She felt uneasy, 
realizing 
she had made a fuss over the hiking pants 
while Gaada Bait lacked a baselayer. 
Despite financial constraints, 
she proposed finding a baselayer for him. 
They re-entered the store 
and found a pair of Outdoor Research pants 
on sale. 
She made a silent prayer 
before proceeding to pay. 
While standing in line, 
she noticed a hiker box 
with a multi-colored fleece on top. 
She shrieked with excitement 
upon seeing it was her size. 
She attempted to pay for the leggings 
but was informed by the cashier that they had already been paid for. 
She and Gaada Bait left crying. 
Gaada Bait never gets trail magic, 
and She-Ra always receives a lot. 
She happily said, 
'Let's go to the other store 
and find you a top.' 
They proceeded down the street 
when a truck honked and stopped 
in front of them. 
It was the couple 
who paid for GB's baselayer bottoms. 
They got out and told GB not to quit 
and to keep going, 
handing him a $100 bill 
and an almost full carton of cigarettes. 
Gaada Bait started crying; 
the couple started crying; 
She-Ra started crying. 
They left,
 telling GB that if he ever needed anything,
to let them know. 
We continued to the next store, 
where we found him a nice top. 
Then, with a smile and a tear in his eye, 
he said, 
'Let's go to McDonald's. 
It's my turn; 
I'm buying.' 
We can dox them, 
picket them, 
or we can keep coming back 
with love and a smile 
and watch the magic unfold. 
One heart at a time. 
We are truly changing the world.
Big Love World 🌎

"I’ve been really inspired recently by hearing all sorts of trail angel stories and even though it's leaving the trail, hitchhiking is a form of trail magic**.** A few weeks ago I picked up a backpacker hitchhiking. He thanked me and we had some small talk while getting on our way. He was doing a loop and midway through his water filter broke. He had some chlorine tablets as backup but thought it best to just head back. I can’t blame him and it was probably the smart thing to do.

When I was 18 my friend and I went hiking and ran into almost the exact situation. There was a hilarity of errors on our part (wrong map, wrong filters, and some miscommunication with a range) and a lot of kindness from strangers. When water ran thin we wandered off trail, found a road, and started walking back to the car. I wouldn’t recommend this at all but luck was on our side that day. Some construction workers gave us water and some maintenance workers let us sit in the bed of their truck for a while. 

I often think back to this story in particular with a feeling of appreciation to all those people that helped our ill-prepared butts. Trail angels give without asking for anything back, and their kindness has become in some ways part hiker culture and more strongly the AT’s entire ethos. For everyone at some point, trail magic turns a hard day into one you’ll never forget.

In a world that sometimes feels short on kindness, trail magic is proof that generosity is alive and well. It’s one of the things that makes the community so special, even beyond the incredible landscapes and wilderness. 

I know there are some great trail magic stories out there. What’s your favorite one?

"After a nasty fall on Tuesday,, Sir Falls-a-lot was right back on the trail the next day. My wife, a prior combat medic in the miltary, patched me up. We left the RV for another day hike.

We had a great chat. We offered to take their trash which they gladly gave up. In exchange, we gave them protein bars and water.  They were very appreciative. We love trail magic.

"10 miles today on the Tuscarora trail at the VA / WV border a bit north of Great North Mountain range. I had planned to hike 12 or 13 miles but had to stop after 10. The Tuscarora gets really overgrown throughout lots of its sections in WV. It can also become impossible to follow without GPS if the blazes areb't frequent enough. I ran into a similar issue at Sleepy Creek WMA last year.

"The sketchiest trail on Mt. Katahdin! Just beyond the northern terminus of the A.T.

The Knife Edge gets a lot of attention, but I thought this spot, where you have to scramble down from Pamola Peak & back up to get to the Knife Edge, was sketchier by far.

This post is interesting because it highlights a specific section of the trail that may not be widely recognized as challenging, specifically the area where hikers ""have to scramble down from Pamola Peak."" Understanding these nuances helps me assess trail conditions and communicate safety information to the public. Additionally, the mention of Class 3-4 scrambles provides insight into the level of difficulty, which is valuable for setting expectations for hikers.

The Appalachian Trail, which we know well in New England, was a core feature of exploring Virginia too. I went to McAfee Knob on the 13th, made a loop over Pine and Haw Orchard mountains on the 14th, and completed a double out-and-back route with Rogers and Whitetop mountains on the 15th. I thought you'd like to see some of my pictures. Enjoy everyone! Also, after the opening five photos, an AllTrails map precedes the shots for each trek. Let it spur ideas or inspiration.

20 mile day! Hiked 6 miles with a very large group at Bull Run / Occoquan. Lots of dying hemlock unfortunately. Followed it up with a 10 mile run and 4 mile walk near home.

"Danielle from Catawba Grocery is just the sweetest! Every time we pop in for anything we need, she brightens our day. So, today I decided to cut down some flowers and bring them over to her as a little thank-you! She’s done so much for us and sent so many folks our way, and we’re just so grateful.

With the new hikers coming in for the SOBO season, I want to spread the love even more! Sometimes that means leaving water out for them to enjoy when they return from their adventures. 

It’s really the little things that make a big difference! 🌼💧

"Molly Knob - Hungry Mother Lake and State Park - Appalachian Mountains - 7.5 miles, 1735ft gains - total for the day: 14 miles,  2750ft gains.  

On my last day in Virginia, I decided one final hike. After Chatfield Shelter hike and the gardens, I added Molly Knob. It's $7 to park but there may be places to park without paying. I parked near Parker Red Fox Discovery Area and started on my way up Lake Trail Loop to CCC Trail. 

Around the 2 mile mark, I took the turn for Molly Knob. This is a 1/4 mile steep and consistently section to the top. But finally, views. :D it was pretty. Took pictures and videos and made my way down to the junction. Made the loop and came around to the lake on the Molly Knob Trail. Wandered about and made my way back through the loop. 

Some areas were meh but other areas were really pretty. Not much in the lines of lake views, only through the trees.

"I saw this Facebook post this morning about the Battle of South Mountain at Fox Gap. If you’ve hiked the Maryland Section of the AT, you may recognize the bottom image of the Reno Monument at Mile 1,043. The above image shows exactly what that crossing looked like during the battle in 1862. This day was one of a series of fights that lasted seven straight days, appropriately called “The Seven Days Battles.”

When I hiked this section, I was doing a SOBO from Pine Grove Furnace to Harper’s Ferry. This crossing had a personal connection with me, because my Great Great Grandfather, Captain Charles McKay of the 57th New York Infantry, fought during this action and was wounded, causing the amputation of his right arm. The Battle of South Mountain was fought three days before the Battle of Antietam, which was the bloodiest day in America (27,000 casualties suffered). My great great grandfather’s wound quite possibly saved his life, for his regiment suffered very high casualties at Antietam Creek.

Anyhow, I thought this may be of interest to some of you and give you historical contex for you to this crossing at the AT in Maryland.

"An long update on a post i made in April about losing my partner to a car crash and hiking with my dog on the trail. Things i learned on a LASH with my 85lb Catahoula:  1) hiking with your dog is absolutely abt how well you know and train your dog. Ruby is used to living off grid with us and so has spent every day all day since he was a puppy working alongside us. He has never once run off in the woods.￼ he’s not not dog, cat chicken, or goat, or human aggressive . I have another dog that’s 35lb pitbull but I would never take on the trail with me because he is too barky and i know he would react to every dog that we saw. ￼be realistic, not optimistic.  #knowthineowndog
2) you’re going to have to go slower. We never did over 14 miles a day. The only reason we could go 12 miles a day consistently was because Ruby is a working breed in peak condition. In two years when he is six/7, I would not attempt this hike. ￼
3) pay attention to your dog. I mean really pay attention. Dogs get overstimulated and use up their social battery just like people. Sometimes I wanted to hang out in a brewery and eat tacos with other people, but Ruby wanted to go for a nighttime stroll, then go to bed…. I always chose Ruby. ￼
4) get a footprint for the inside of your tent, so the claws don’t poke through or rip your tent floor. 
5) people on the trail are a lot nicer, and more understanding than the Internet. ￼
6) ￼ don’t try to train your dog on the trail. Do  before. it Recall/ leave it/ stay close/ heel/ all those commands need to be almost perfect by the time you get on the trail for your sanity and everyone elses. ￼ Ruby has gone through service dog training, and that is immediately apparent when you meet him. Having a friendly dog is not enough. Having a dog that understands that being an aware and sensibleHiking buddy is his job is what you need. 
7) never stay in a shelter with your dog, even if no one else is there. Tent every night. Dealing with rodents and a dogs reaction to rodents is not your friend. 
￼8) it’s worth it to mail yourself or Amazon yourself really high-quality dog food at various stops along the trail even if you have to supplement with grocery store food sometimes.
At home, Ruby eats a raw diet mixed with super high-quality working breed food … it really made a difference, not trying to switch to something like Purina on the trail ￼￼, but continuing with working dog feed and paying the Amazon prices for small bags. ￼ when we were in town, Ruby got his own hamburger patty every time I went out to eat.
9) ￼ hike far from the bubble. Hike in the dregs and stragglers. It’s more peaceful and fewer people means less people with opinions about your dog . ￼￼
10) if your dog lose his enthusiasm for the hike. Your hike is over. Every morning, Ruby would bring me his pack and nudge me wanting me to get going because he loves Hiking. I promised myself that if any morning he even ran away from the pack or didn’t want to get going, I would take a zero day. And if we had two days in a row where he didn’t want to wear his pack, I would get off the trail.—-this never happened and now we’re home and he still brings me his pack sometimes hoping that we’ll get back on trail. ￼ but it was the promise I made to myself before I left. ￼

Pack weight: i never put more than 4lbs on him even though the vet said 8 was ok. I would rather carry more than risk injuring him — and having to carry/trevois an 85 pound dog if he got injured was just not it. I also carried a squeezy tube of super high calorie dog supplement made of bovine colostrum. It’s like a dog honey bun in terms of getting calories into him. ￼

"I was talking to a friend and he was talking about a recent run-in with some bears on trail. This started me down a rabbit hole of bear facts. Black bear season is at its peak from May to August on the AT so we just finished it. But just because it’s September doesn’t mean it’s a bad time to brush up on some black bear info! Here's a breakdown of some fact vs. fiction:

**Fiction: **Black bears are aggressive and want to attack hikers.
**Fact: **Black bears are naturally shy and usually avoid people. Attacks are extremely rare, because most bears want nothing to do with you.

**Fiction: **Playing dead is the best defense against a black bear.
**Fact: **That’s for grizzlies. With black bears, making noise, standing tall, and backing away slowly is the safer bet.

**Fiction: **Guns will protect you from a bear.
**Fact: **More people die from defending themselves with a gun than with bear spray. Essentially, the spray elicits a flight response rather than a fight response.

**Honorable mention:** Don't leave food out. A fed bear is a dead bear.

The truth is, hiking in black bear country isn’t something to fear, but it is something to prepare for. My last encounter was a few years ago when I was with a friend. We were just before lunch and in a bit of a low. I hear ""Oh sh*t"" and look up. To my left was baby bear and to my right was mama bear. I went from drowsy to an adrenaline high in no time flat as I sprinted down the trail. Luckily there was no pursuit or harm. Respecting their space is a necessity (and don't be like me, look up)! Be smart with food, know how to react, and remember that the trail is their home, we’re just visiting.

What's your black bear on trail story?

"Sandstone Falls - New River - Appalachian Mountains - New River Gorge National Park and Preserve, West Virginia - 1.8 miles - total for the day: 14.5 miles, 4004ft gains. 

It was Sandstone Falls that brought me to the park in the first place. I was looking for places fairly close to my moms I can go hiking. I saw a picture for Sandstone Falls and looked it up. Less than 2 hours away? :o let me know more. I started puzzling pieces to see as much as possible. Everything worked out perfectly. Started with Endless Wall Trail, gorgeous. Fayetteville and Kaymoor Trails, incredible. Skipped Grandview because I didn't want to run out of time to have dinner with my mom. Then, Sandstone Falls. 

It's about an hour and 20 minutes to the falls from Fayetteville. It takes you through the historic town of Hinton, over a bridge over New River, and back down a 8 mile stretch of road to a parkinglot.  

The boardwalk starts immediately and it's beautiful. I got off a few times and trekked about on my own, looking for better views of the falls. There's picnic areas and camping along the road. What a beautiful day, in a beautiful place with beautiful weather. After seeing the end of the boardwalk and the other side of the falls, I look the Island Loop Trail and headed back. I'm so so so glad I got to see this park. 💜

Fun fact: Sandstone Falls is the largest falls on the New River at 1500ft wide, some of the drops at 10ft and some up to 25ft.",https://www.facebook.com/groups/1082114541911181,UzpfSTUzNDQ1ODY1NjpWSzo5MjA2MDE1NTEyODU0MzM2,2025-04-23 16:00:55+00:00,spring,neutral,0.5874,"challenging, scenic","Error: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for gpt-4o-mini in organization org-CDRIzO2QPMzCZ3xL0xcnjqNL on tokens per min (TPM): Limit 200000, Used 200000, Requested 684.

"I’m far from a photographer, but this fake looking photo is real ( kinda reminds me of those weird photo booth pics in the eighties).  If you told me ten years ago I would be sitting by a fire having beverages with a friend I met on the AT, I would have told you it was a dream at best.  Had you told me I would have a friend who would invite me to Maine, help me hike some miles while I visited and then sit me in front of a camp fire by a lake with Katahdin sitting in the background and the Northern Lights kicking off a show, I’d have said “what are you smoking?!”, but here I am writing about it and still in disbelief.

"What is the Appalachian trail 

It isn’t a mountain 
It isn’t a place 
It’s not a person wide 
It occupies no space 

It’s not a he
It’s not a she  
It’s not the wildlife  
It’s not the trees   

You can’t get there by car
And not by plane 
A boat can’t take you there 
And neither will a train 

The trail isn’t a secret 
Its difficult to explain
But it cannot be found 
Within any terrain 

You can’t learn it
You can’t teach it 
You can’t give it away
And you’ll never - ever reach it 

It’s not one thing 
It’s not this thing or that
It is everything together 
A metaphorical treasure map 

So what is this thing?
This imaginary state? 
Is it an idea?
Is it something anyone can create? 

It is endless and eternal
and try as you might
You can never explain what it is   
With a mind that’s finite

It is everything and nothing  
It doesn’t succeed or fail
Life isn’t a scoreboard 
And neither is the trail 

There are no words or pronouns 
To describe or define its bliss
It’s just an experience 
That you cannot avoid & you cannot  miss

The trail breathes 
It’s alive 
It doe not separate 
It does not divide 

It is intelligent 
It is smart 
It talks to us 
It speaks to the heart

It cannot be conquered 
You can never win
It is the light within you 
A light that can never fade or dim 

The trail isn’t for hiking 
It’s not just leave no trace 
Its a magical journey 
To an unexplored space

You can travel this trail 
No matter where you are at
For the trail isn’t a destination 
You’ll never find it on any map

It’s being alone with your thoughts
And it’s solitude galore .  
Its letting go of everything 
Because LESS is always MORE

If You want to understand yourself
There’s no need to go far 
Because exploring this trail 
You find out exactly who & what YOU are

So where are you going 
There’s no place to be 
The Appalachian Trail is YOU and
The Appalachian Trail is ME

"Kaymoor Mine Site - New River Gorge National Park and Preserve, West Virginia.  

Remember those 826 stairs I told you about the other day? That then turned into 959 stairs? Well this is what it lead me to. The Kaymoor Trail leads to an old coal mining area. Down below you get views of the old railways, the gorge, and the town that once was. If I remember correctly, the population of this little town was about 550 people. The site operated for 60 years and was abandoned in 1963. 

I really enjoyed exploring around the bottom. It was so interesting. I've done a little research since on the area and just find it fascinating.  The coolest part, it really wasn't that long ago this place was active. It does leave me with a lot of questions. :) let the researching begin.

"Little Brushy Mt, around 3000ft elevation, on the Appalachian Trail - Little Brushy Mountains - Appalachian Mountains - Jefferson National Forest - 12.6 miles, 2400ft gains. 

It was a cool, overcast and windy morning but 7am, I laced up my shoes, zipped up my wind breaker, situated my hat and walked out the door. The Davis Valley Rd/AT junction is really pretty, green rolling hills going into the trees. I had to step over this latter thing but after that the trail just took off. 

I passed a spring and a campground for backpackers. Another mile or so, I came across a shelter potty, picnic bench, and a few spaces for tents. It's just a quiet stroll in the bald trees. There's a few spots where you can look beyond the trees but the views really are limited throughout. 

I hiked to where the trail said was Little Brushy Mt but there was no markers, signs, or significance to that area. So, time to turn back. It was almost exactly 6 miles up. On the way back, there was a junction to 🤷‍♀️ there was no signs. I was chasing views and it was a high point area so I took the side excursion. No views and I got bite by nature twice. Whatever spikey branches were there, were sharp and got me on the front and back on the left knee. 

Headed back down but instead of getting off the AT at Davis Valley, I continued on about a mile. This section follows a wild flower filled trail with a creek and bridge. Shortly after the bridge, the trail meets up with the highway and crosses to the other side of the overpass and continues on.",https://www.facebook.com/groups/1082114541911181,UzpfSTUzNDQ1ODY1NjpWSzo5MTQ1NTAzNDE1NTcyMjEz,2025-04-12 20:43:38+00:00,spring,neutral,0.4914,"fun, scenic, wildlife","Error: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for gpt-4o-mini in organization org-CDRIzO2QPMzCZ3xL0xcnjqNL on requests per min (RPM): Limit 500, Used 500, Requested 1.

Started on the trail to the top, a very nice, quiet trail. High Rocks is exactly what I expected with pretty views of the valley and towns below. Lots of summit flies and views of a tower. Took the loop way back down. It was just nice and peaceful out. Just me on trail. There's a junction that leads to the boundary trial. After a couple miles, it'll eventually lead to Crystal Springs.
