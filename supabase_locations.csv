"I’m planning to do my first section of the Appalachian Trail from Winding Stair Gap to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) from October 17–19th and I had a few questions for anyone who’s done this section recently:
 • Is this a good section to do in mid-October in terms of weather, views, and overall conditions?
 • Do I need a bear canister for this stretch, or will a proper hang be fine?
 • Any recommendations for reliable shuttle drivers in the area?
 • Lastly, how’s the water situation right now—are most sources still flowing, or should I plan to carry extra?

Appreciate any insight or recent updates! 
Trying to make sure I’m fully prepared before heading out.",https://www.facebook.com/groups/819170279191773,2025-10-07T10:21:09,"['Appalachian Trail', 'Winding Stair Gap', 'Nantahala Outdoor Center']",first section of the Appalachian Trail from Winding Stair Gap
"Just wanted to introduce myself. Trail name: ""Mit"". Section hiker who decided to keep walking South (Harpers Ferry to Erwin, TN) Hopped off today and currently sitting at an obnoxiously loud travel lodge in Greenville, TN awaiting a Greyhound. Have to fulfill an obligation but I'll will be back at Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel in a couple weeks to continue south. Apps are great for resources but community, for me, has been the most beneficial resource. Guess thats why I'm joining this group. So if you see me say, ""hello"". Oh yeah, if you see a headlamp go by at crazy hours of the night thats probably me. Much love.",https://www.facebook.com/groups/819170279191773,2025-10-07T02:20:54,"['Harpers Ferry', 'Erwin', 'Greenville', ""Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel""]","Harpers Ferry to Erwin, TN"
"Calling all 2025 AT Thru-Hikers!

Did you (or someone you know) attempt OR successfully thru-hike the Appalachian Trail this year?  

Then we need your help! 

Please fill out The Trek's 2025 Appalachian Trail Thru-Hiker Survey! 

Here's the link 👉 https://thetrek.co/appalachian-trail/the-2025-appalachian-trail-thru-hiker-survey-is-here/

For the last 11 years, The Trek has polled the current class of AT hikers to learn the ins and outs of their on-trail experiences.  We strive to better understand what worked and what didn’t — and why — in hopes of better educating future hikers and enabling as many people as possible to fulfill their thru-hiking dreams.

So please take 20 minutes to fill out this survey, or send it to an AT thru-hiker friend.

THANK YOU!",https://www.facebook.com/groups/819170279191773,2025-10-06T18:08:16,['Appalachian Trail'],thru-hike the Appalachian Trail this year

I’m looking to start a NOBO hike in March and am currently gathering gear. I live in the Virgin Islands and (shockingly 😂) we do not have any outdoor stores that cater to backpackers. I’d like to plan a trip to somewhere stateside to make sure I have properly fitting gear (think boots, clothes, pack, etc.) without having to order and return a bunch of stuff via mail. 

What cities would you suggest traveling to? Top of my list might be Boulder, Portland, or Boston. I’m also on a budget, if that makes a difference.

Met one thru hiker who gladly took the extra Gatorade I offered, two section hikers, and about 10 hikers who were doing a shorter hike from Dripping Rock to the first or second overlook.

"Hey folks,
So I’ve been looking at Warrior Expeditions while mapping out my Appalachian Trail plans. On the surface, it all looks shiny and solid — but I’ve also seen a couple things that make me tilt my head like, “hmm, is this for real or just good marketing?”

Has anyone here actually gone through their program or dealt with them face-to-face? I’m not after the brochure version — just the boots-on-the-ground truth.

I’m all about vets getting opportunities like this, but before I dive in, I’d love to know if this is truly juice worth the squeeze… or just a lemon.

Appreciate any firsthand insight — and feel free to tell me straight.

"Hi all! Thanks for welcoming me into the group. I'm a northeasterner who hiked in Virginia for the first time in April. Your mountains were a delightful change of pace! The Appalachian Trail, which we know well in New England, was a core feature of exploring Virginia too. I went to McAfee Knob on the 13th, made a loop over Pine and Haw Orchard mountains on the 14th, and completed a double out-and-back route with Rogers and Whitetop mountains on the 15th. I thought you'd like to see some of my pictures. Enjoy everyone! Also, after the opening five photos, an AllTrails map precedes the shots for each trek. Let it spur ideas or inspiration. I'll return to the state, for sure. ⛰",https://www.facebook.com/groups/557017865207812,2025-05-08T12:06:09,"['Virginia', 'Appalachian Trail', 'McAfee Knob', 'Pine Mountain', 'Haw Orchard Mountain', 'Rogers Mountain', 'Whitetop Mountain']",hiked in Virginia for the first time

"She revisited the outfitter, 
choosing the same salesman. 
She approached him with a smile, saying 
'It's me again,' while holding up her pants. 
He smiled and replied, 
'I suppose you'd like to try them on,' before retrieving the key. 
Although the pants were costly, 
they were discounted by half. 
She purchased them and exited the store, 
where her trusted hiking partner, 
Gaada Bait, was waiting. 
She felt uneasy, 
realizing 
she had made a fuss over the hiking pants 
while Gaada Bait lacked a baselayer. 
Despite financial constraints, 
she proposed finding a baselayer for him. 
They re-entered the store 
and found a pair of Outdoor Research pants 
on sale. 
She made a silent prayer 
before proceeding to pay. 
While standing in line, 
she noticed a hiker box 
with a multi-colored fleece on top. 
She shrieked with excitement 
upon seeing it was her size. 
She attempted to pay for the leggings 
but was informed by the cashier that they had already been paid for. 
She and Gaada Bait left crying. 
Gaada Bait never gets trail magic, 
and She-Ra always receives a lot. 
She happily said, 
'Let's go to the other store 
and find you a top.' 
They proceeded down the street 
when a truck honked and stopped 
in front of them. 
It was the couple 
who paid for GB's baselayer bottoms. 
They got out and told GB not to quit 
and to keep going, 
handing him a $100 bill 
and an almost full carton of cigarettes. 
Gaada Bait started crying; 
the couple started crying; 
She-Ra started crying. 
They left,
 telling GB that if he ever needed anything,
to let them know. 
We continued to the next store, 
where we found him a nice top. 
Then, with a smile and a tear in his eye, 
he said, 
'Let's go to McDonald's. 
It's my turn; 
I'm buying.' 
We can dox them, 
picket them, 
or we can keep coming back 
with love and a smile 
and watch the magic unfold. 
One heart at a time. 
We are truly changing the world.
Big Love World 🌎

"Danielle from Catawba Grocery is just the sweetest! Every time we pop in for anything we need, she brightens our day. So, today I decided to cut down some flowers and bring them over to her as a little thank-you! She’s done so much for us and sent so many folks our way, and we’re just so grateful.

With the new hikers coming in for the SOBO season, I want to spread the love even more! Sometimes that means leaving water out for them to enjoy when they return from their adventures. 

It’s really the little things that make a big difference! 🌼💧

"I'm new to the group. I've done multiple section hikes and started hiking the Smokies at the age of 5 or 7 for family day hikes. I've worked through several issues each time I have completed a section hike as an adult. I hope to start my thru hike next spring. 
I'm still not certain on my sleeping pad. I'm a side or stomach sleeper. 
Also...I'm not a fan of rain gear. I know that it it is needed. I need it to be breathable as I am claustrophobic. Suggestions welcome. 
How do umbrellas work? Sometimes it rains sideways!
I'll have many of my dehydrated meals mailed to me, but I will be glad to enjoy town dinners. I will also be planning on Mountain House and DG an WM packaged foods, as well.",https://www.facebook.com/groups/819170279191773,2025-09-01T01:04:21,['Smokies'],hiking the Smokies at the age of 5

"So I was sitting around reminiscing, as I often do these days, thinking about hiking and trekking the Appalachians. I recalled a hike along the Appalachian Trail across Carver's Gap on Roan Mountain on the Tennessee - North Carolina border back in the late 80s. It was one of many tune-up hikes Geanne and I took in preparation for a more strenuous trek in the Andes Mountains later that next year. Back then there was no one on the trail. The day was clear and sunny as I recall, but cold and windy as...well, you know. Nary a sole did we meet that day, and we spent a good while at Grassy Ridge Bald, a sun-drenched, grassy summit that tops out at over 6100 feet, offering extraordinary views into both states. Well, a couple of years ago in the late fall the experience was quite different  There were people everywhere - wall to wall. Cars were parked up and down the highway, dogs on leashes, hikers of all ages with their ski poles, designer backpacks and Ray-Bans. I thought I was at Dollywood for a second. It was good to see folks of all kinds enjoying a beautiful walk along the AT on such a crisp afternoon. The temperature was a balmy 35°. I just marveled at the looks on all their faces as my mind recalled my own experiences when I wore a younger man's clothes. I felt my time was passing like a hand waving from a train. There are a few moments in your life when you are truly and completely happy, and you remember to give thanks. Even as it happens you are nostalgic for the moment, you are tucking it away in your scrapbook. Nostalgia is a necessary thing, I believe, and a way for all of us to find peace in that which we have accomplished, or even failed to accomplish. John Muir said, “Keep close to Nature’s heart and break clear away once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean. Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul. When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world. Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt.” Enjoy these crisp sunny Spring days.

Good morning everyone I'm very excited to join this group. So we live in Virginia Beach and we always go to an Appalachian Trail to hike because really that's the best hiking I think in Virginia. But is there anything within a 2-hour distance from Virginia Beach say Richmond where we would get a really good hike? We live right down the street from First Landing State Park so we can always go there but we're bored with it and it's not challenging enough when we don't want to drive the three and a half to 4 hours away for an Appalachian Trail so we're really trying to find something within 2 hours that would be worth our Drive.

Hear It From a Recent Guest: 10/10 for The Chapman House

We were looking for a weekend escape in the beautiful Hudson Valley before our daughter goes to college that wasn't too far away from our home in Long Island, and we found the perfect spot.

The accommodations exceeded our expectations in every way. The room was spacious and beautifully decorated - a lovely blend of modern amenities with cozy country charm. It was spacious enough for what was essentially three adults, with a very comfortable pull out and our own room. 

Pawling itself is an absolute gem! The town is adorable and there's so much to explore in the surrounding area. 

The host was wonderfully communicative and gave us a heads up about the occasional train passing through. Honestly, after all our hiking, I was so soundly asleep that I didn't hear a thing!

This was such a wonderful family experience that I'm already planning to book another stay with my other two children. Can't wait to return to this special place!

10/10 experience! 

Thank you to Inna from Long Island who stayed at The Chapman House for your rave review - come experience Station Pawling Inn and the charming town of Pawling for yourself!",https://www.facebook.com/groups/819170279191773,2025-08-19T12:15:47,"['Hudson Valley', 'Pawling', 'Long Island']",a weekend escape in the beautiful Hudson Valley

"One of our favorite hiking spots in Virginia is the first landing state park.  it may fascinate you that we have this incredible piece of history that’s been hidden. It is accessible to the public. 
The First Landing 1607 Project team is dedicated to making more Virginians - and Americans - aware of the significance of the historical event that took place on April 29th, 1607 on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia Beach, Virginia, as a Covenant was made with God, establishing America as a safe haven for Christians  

Our team believes that many Virginians will proudly display their First Landing plates.

To make the First Landing 1607 license plate a reality, we must have 450 “pre-order” requests in by Dec. 31st. All applications and payments must be in by the 2025 General Assembly session in January.

Would like to start hiking sections the AT next year but would like to be more prepared. I am 50 yrs old and not worried about the physical part. I don’t do well with online learning and ready for the hands on part.

I would be open to a guide, or experienced camper who could help a newbie gain some experience. Patience required 🤣 would be open to paying expenses or for someone’s time if they have experience and could provide the education part.

"Psst....

Are you visiting the Central District of Shenandoah National Park this weekend?

As first-time angels of any ilk, we’re excited to announce that we’ll be hosting a pop-up event on Sunday, August 3, 2025! Join us bright and early at 6 AM as we fill the forest with the delicious aroma of bacon. We’ll keep serving until either the food runs out, my knees give out, or 2 PM—whichever comes first!

We’re offering a simple yet delightful menu featuring mostly homemade dishes: casseroles, plenty of eggs, potatoes, fresh fruit, French toast, authentic corned beef hash, pancakes, and burgers (including vegan options). Other offeringswill ensure you leave with a renewed sense of flavor.

If you head south from Bearfence Rock Shelter for about 0.9 miles, you’ll find us at a picnic area just a 2-minute walk from the main trail, where the bacon will beckon you to our canopy.

**Important updates!** After some thoughtful feedback and discussions with our team, I want to clarify a few things: First and foremost, come hungry! We can’t wait to share our passion for cooking with you in this beautiful park setting. Secondly, feel free to leave your contact info; our expert nurses will gladly perform a non-invasive forehead instant temperature check, which may provide useful information for you. We hope our comfort food will help you feel comfortable discussing any concerns about nagging foot issues, non-healing wounds, or general wellness. Our goal aligns with yours: to keep you on the trail and provide support!

Wash stations and restrooms are available.

There will be a dog with us—her name is Kyleigh. The best way to win her over is simply to ignore her! Please remember not to feed any animals in SNP, including Kyleigh.

By the way, our hostel and infirmary is located about 2-3 days’ hike south of Rockfish Gap.

Check us out at www.BleesRockfishRetreat.com for more information and feel free to grab some business cards to share with friends and neighbors.

Looking forward to meeting you!",https://www.facebook.com/groups/819170279191773,2025-08-03T02:31:53,"['Shenandoah National Park', 'Bearfence Rock Shelter', 'Rockfish Gap']",visiting the Central District of Shenandoah National Park

"Psst....

You close to the Central District of the Shenandoah National Park this weekend?

Being a first-time angel of any sort, We are (?)prepared to furnish a Trail Angel pop-up on Sunday, August 3, 2025.  We should be up and fanning bacon aroma throughout the forest primeval by 6 am and quitting when a) food runs out;  b) my knees give way; or 2 pm whichever comes first!

We are featuring a simple, yet versatile menu of (mostly) homemade dishes:  several casseroles, potatoes, eggs o’ plenty, fruit, French Toast, corned beef hash (the real thing), pancakes, burger and dogs (vegan “dogs” available).  Several salads and sides should give you a renewed sense of flavor.

If you head south from Bearfence Rock Shelter for .9 mi, the bacon will beckon as we are at a picnc area about 2 mins from the main trail.  All we ask is that you complete a short contact form, have your temperature recorded, and eat small portions over and over.  Wash stations and restrooms are available.

Nurses are available for your healing and entertainment.

There will be a dog with us, just ignore her is the best way to win her over.  Absolutely no food should be given to any animals in SNP and Kyleigh is no exception.  

Coincidentally, our hostel and infirmary is about 2-3 days hike south off of Rockfish Gap.

Check us out.  We launched late, so expect a pocket full of business cards to distribute to friends and neighbors.

BleesRockfishRetreat.com for more info.

"Hiker Heaven at Station Inn Pawling

At the Station Inn we’re more than just a place to rest: we’re a hiker's haven! Nestled in the charming town of Pawling, NY, we’ve been a favorite stop for Appalachian Trail hikers looking for a cozy retreat after a long day on the trail. 

www.stationinnpawling.com

Whether you're taking a quick break or enjoying a longer stay, our inn offers:
*  Comfortable rooms to help you unwind
*  Local restaurants to satisfy your appetite - go to [O'Connor's Public House Pawling](https://www.facebook.com/oconnorspawling?__tn__=-]) for a classic pub experience, grab a slice at Village Pizza, indulge in a meal at [McKinney & Doyle Fine Foods Cafe / The Corner Bakery](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063952782895&__tn__=-]) for something upscale, or pick up a hearty sandwich at [Vinny's Deli & Pasta](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100059639156902&__tn__=-]) (featured on Food Network!).
* Easy access to the train— just a short walk from the inn, so you can take a day trip to NYC and explore the city before getting back on the trail!

We understand the effort it takes to hike the AT, and we love being a part of your adventure. After all, the journey is about the memories you make, the people you meet, and the little stops along the way that give you the rest you need.

To all the hikers out there, we can’t wait to welcome you! Whether you're heading north to Maine or south to Georgia, the Station Inn is the perfect spot to pause, relax, and recharge.

See you soon!

"Big Announcement!

Hey everyone — I’m excited to share that I’ll be attempting an FKT (Fastest Known Time) on the Appalachian Trail next year. This will be one of the biggest challenges I’ve ever taken on, but I’m ready to give it everything I’ve got.

To make this dream a reality, I’ll need a strong support crew. I’m reaching out to the amazing AT community for help — I’ll be looking for pacers, folks to assist at resupply points, and anyone who wants to be part of this journey in any way.

If you’ve ever dreamed of being part of an epic adventure, I’d love to have you along for the ride. Let’s make some history together!

Feel free to reach out if you’re interested or just want to follow along. More details to come!",https://www.facebook.com/groups/819170279191773,2025-07-28T15:20:34,['Appalachian Trail'],attempting an FKT on the Appalachian Trail

My cousin David and I set out to hike Bad Branch to High Rock on the PMT.  Turns out the parking area at Bad Branch Falls is closed and the trail up from there is closed indefinitely. We proceeded to the PMT trailhead at US119 and hiked to High Rock from there and back.

"I searched high and low and did not find anything like this on Facebook or Instagram, except for a couple covering all of Virginia and several for NOVA, so I will give it a go.  The hope of this is that it will grow into a community of Central Virginia hikers, that could possibly meet up for group hikes.  

There were several of these, where we lived in Colorado Springs and they were pretty cool.

Things that won’t be tolerated, bullying, sexual harassment, racism or just being a regular ole butt head.

"Hello friends! Last year my friends & I started our maiden voyage to section hiking and we finished about 45miles in GA. One of the best things was having a night at a hostel. I think we had the best showers & the best crappy pizza of our lives! Being that we were new to section hiking, of course, we carried way too much weight! The owner of the hostel we stayed at is an avid hiker so he gave us some ""real world"" advice for cutting down our weight. He even made us a full hot breakfast and dropped us back at the trail. I don't think we appreciated a lodging experience ever before that we were so grateful for!

Since then my husband & I opened our first airb&b in Hiawassee, GA! I wanted to offer it up here for anyone entering or exiting the trails here in Towns County. We're open all year!

$150 per night includes 2 people. Add $50 per night per person for up to 4 total (1 king bed, 2 twin beds) including shuttle service to & from the trail and into town for refilling. Washer & dryer (& loaner pajamas) are on site & we'll come in to fix breakfast each morning!

Let us know if you're interested!",https://www.facebook.com/groups/819170279191773,2025-07-11T13:24:12,"['GA', 'Hiawassee', 'Towns County']",we finished about 45miles in GA

Very difficult long mileage day with the heat but cooler days are finally coming! I counted nine yellow jacket nests along the trail and almost all of them had been raided by some sort of animal. Most people assume bears but a lot of times the culprit is a skunk.

Take plenty of water if you tackle this one. The only fill up is the pump at Hensley Settlement.
